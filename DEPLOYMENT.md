## üöÄ Deploy to GitHub & Vercel

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

### Step 2: Push to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Run these in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)

   - Build Command: `npm run build` (default)
   - Output Directory: `.next` (default)
